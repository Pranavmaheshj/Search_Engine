  "summary": "It seems like the Misfits discography thread got sidetracked.\n\nHowever, this seems related to your query about the writer of a song inspired by words on a tombstone and the first track of the box set 'Back to Mono.'  Based on your new context:\n\nThe song you're asking about might belong to Elvis Presley. The box set 'Back to Mono' is 'Elvis: Back in Mono,' which is a compilation of Elvis' mono studio and mixes of his work from the 1950s to the 1960s. \n\nOne song inspired by words on a tombstone on this box set is \"Stuck on You.\" However, a more likely candidate for your question could be \"It Feels So Right\" or 'It Feels So Right' is not a popular song but \"It Feels So Right\" does share a theme on a tombstone.",
