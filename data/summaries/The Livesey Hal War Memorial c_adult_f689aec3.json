  "age_group": "adult",
  "summary": "It appears that the extracted data is incomplete and irrelevant to the provided query. \n\nGiven that The Livesey Hill War Memorial commemorates the fallen of World War I, it's worth noting that World War I was a global conflict that occurred from 1914 to 1918, resulting in over 37 million casualties. However, it is also possible that you are referring to The Lijssenhuusen Hal or possibly another Livesey war memorial that commemorates a war with 60 million casualties, but this is not clear in the provided data.\n\nIf the information provided in the query is referring to World War II, then the correct answer would be World War II, which had over 50 million casualties.",
