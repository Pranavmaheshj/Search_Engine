  "age_group": "adult",
  "summary": "Based on the given context, there is no information regarding Manchester Terriers or Scotch Collies discussing their ancestry in relation to Gordon and Irish Setters. However, I can provide information on the origins of these breeds.\n\nThe Manchester Terrier originated in England in the mid-19th century as a result of crossbreeding the Old English Black Terrier and the ratting Terrier. Although the exact ancestry involves various Terrier types from England, there's no direct evidence that it was bred from Gordon and Irish Setters.\n\nThe Scotch Collie, a breed of herding dog, also originated in the United Kingdom, specifically in the Scottish Lowlands in the 19th century. It was bred from the Old Collie, which shares ancestry with various other Collie and Shepherd breeds from the region. However, again, there's no established evidence of direct involvement in the ancestry of Gordon and Irish Setters in the creation of the Scotch Collie. They're more likely to be related due to their shared history and geographic origins in the United Kingdom, but a detailed examination is needed to confirm specific links between these breeds.\n\nTo conclude, neither the Manchester Terrier nor the Scotch Collie's direct ancestors are definitively known to include Gordon and Irish Setters based on the given information.",
