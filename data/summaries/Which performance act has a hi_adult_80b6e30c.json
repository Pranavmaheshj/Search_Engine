  "summary": "The provided information appears to be a corrupted PDF document. However, to analyze the question about the instrument to person ratio of Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice, I'll provide general information about the two artists.\n\nBadly Drawn Boy, whose real name is Damon Gough, is a British singer-songwriter and musician known for his solo work and collaborations. As a solo artist, he often performs with an instrument, typically an acoustic guitar or piano, accompanied by occasional guest musicians.\n\nWolf Alice, on the other hand, is a British indie rock band consisting of Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitar, backing vocals), Theo Ellis (bass guitar), and Joey McNeil (drums). As a band, they typically perform with multiple instruments, including guitars, bass, and drums.\n\nConsidering the general setup of these performances, I would infer that Wolf Alice has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Badly Drawn Boy, as they are a band with multiple musicians performing various instruments, whereas Badly Drawn Boy often performs solo or with minimal accompaniment.\n\nHere is a simple table for your clarity.\n\n| Artist | Number of People | Number of Instruments | Instrument to Person Ratio |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Badly Drawn Boy | 1 (solo performances) | 1-2 (guitar/piano, occasionally more) | 1:1-1:2 |\n| Wolf Alice | 4 (vocals, 2 guitars, bass, drums) | 4 (guitar, bass, drums, sometimes more) | 1:1 |\n\nPlease note that the instrument to person ratio may vary depending on specific performances and live arrangements. This summary is a general analysis based on common setups for these artists.",
