  "summary": "It seems there is some confusion in your prompt. You provided a paper titled 'RAG-R1 : Incentivize the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism' but then started quoting from another unrelated paper. \n\nTo answer your original question, 'Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?' we will need to focus on the botanical classification of these two plants.\n\nDictyosperma is indeed a genus in the family Aroideae, subfamily Aroideae. It is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.\n\nHuernia, on the other hand, is also a genus in the family Apocynaceae.",
