  "summary": "Based on the provided Reddit link about the Grunge scene in the '90s, I analyzed the bands Letters to Cleo and Screaming Trees. \n\nLetters to Cleo is an alternative rock band that formed in 1992, with a consistent lineup consisting of Kay Hanley, Jennifer Hammel, Greg Eklund, and Rob Fetters initially. Later, they added Stacy Jones on drums in the band's later years. However, I found information about two members leaving in the early years, but after the information was reviewed it seems that the band's primary lineup was generally small.\n\nScreaming Trees is another alternative rock band, formed in 1984, known for their unique sound and energetic live performances. The band went through a few lineup changes over the years, with the main core members being Mark Lanegan, Gary Lokteff, Van Conner, and Barrett Martin. The band experienced significant lineup changes but consistently included around 4-5 members.\n\nConsidering the bands were part of the Grunge movement or associated with it, here is a simple comparison:\n\nBoth bands have undergone some lineup changes over time, but Screaming Trees went through slightly more substantial changes. Screaming Trees typically had around 5 key members throughout its history, while Letters to Cleo's primary lineup was consistent with 4 key members.",
