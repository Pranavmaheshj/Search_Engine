  "summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nBased on the provided information, it is unclear which writer was from England between Henry Roth and Robert Erskine Childers. However, some additional research can provide more information.\n\n**Henry Roth**\n\nHenry Roth (1887-1964) was a American author. He is best known for his novels about the lives of early 20th-century Jewish immigrants and their experiences in New York City and the Lower East Side. Roth's most notable work is `Call It Sleep (1934)`.\n\n**Robert Erskine Childers**\n\nRobert Erskine Childers (1870-1922) was an Irish author and intelligence officer. Childers is best known for his novel `The Riddle of the Sands`, a thriller about a German plot to invade the United Kingdom. The novel was first published in 1903 and has since been adapted into films and is widely regarded as one of the earliest spy novels.\n\nBased on the research, it appears that Robert Erskine Childers is the one who was from the UK (specifically Ireland, but was a member of the upper class in England), and Henry Roth was an American author.",
