  "summary": "**Executive Summary: The Defeat of Alexander Kerensky and the End of the Russian Civil War**\n\n**Background:** Alexander Kerensky led the Russian Provisional Government from July 1917 to November 1917, during a tumultuous period of the Russian Revolution. He was succeeded by Vladimir Lenin as the leader of the Soviet government.\n\n**The October Revolution:** The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, seized power in the October Revolution, replacing Kerensky's government. The Bolsheviks then established a new government in coalition with the Left SRs.\n\n**The Russian Civil War:** Following the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks faced opposition from various factions, including the Russian White Army. The civil war lasted until the Bolsheviks' victory in 1922.\n\n**Key Date for the End of the Civil War:** The Russian Civil War ended with the Bolsheviks' victory in October 1922, although some fighting continued until the Treaty of Riga in March 1921. However, I was asked to describe the civil war ending, the closest date I can describe is that the civil war ended when the Treaty of Riga was signed.\n\n**Outcome:** Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the civil war. He fled Russia and lived in exile, while Lenin and the Bolsheviks consolidated their power and established the Soviet Union.\n\nOverall, the defeat of Alexander Kerensky marked the end of the Provisional Government and the beginning of Soviet rule in Russia, with the civil war serving as a catalyst for the establishment of the Soviet Union.",
