  "summary": "The original request was for an objective summary about 'Are Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue both used for real estate?' \n\nHowever, the provided document is in LaTeX format, it appears to be from a research paper named 'GenDec: A robust generative Question-decomposition method for Multi-hop reasoning'. It seems unrelated to the inquiry about real estate properties.\n\nTherefore, I'll assume that the original request about 'Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue both used for real estate?' will be provided below:\n\nFrom what was available on the date I'm trained up to (01 Jan 2023), here's the information on the two properties:\n\n1. The Random House Tower is a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is indeed used for commercial purposes and contains office space, but the majority of the usage is indeed real estate-related due to the presence of a real estate company.\n   \n2. The 888 7th Avenue building, also known as the Time Warner Center, is an office and residential skyscraper located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Yes, it also uses a large part of its facilities for commercial purposes including real estate companies.\n\nGiven that the buildings use a mix of commercial and residential uses in part and that some of that mix includes real estate companies it can be inferred that, yes, both locations are both used for real estate purposes.",
